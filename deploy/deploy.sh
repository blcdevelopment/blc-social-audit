# Remote deploy script — runs ON the Linode box.
#
# It is streamed in over SSH by .github/workflows/deploy.yml on every merge to
# main, and rolls the running production stack forward to that commit. It is the
# exact, automated form of the manual day-2 command documented in DEPLOYMENT.md
# (`git pull && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`).
#
# You can also run it by hand on the box for a manual deploy / re-deploy:
#
#   cd ~/blc-social-audit && bash deploy/deploy.sh             # deploy origin/main HEAD
#   cd ~/blc-social-audit && bash deploy/deploy.sh <commitsha> # deploy a specific commit
#
# Prerequisites on the box (already satisfied per DEPLOYMENT.md §2–5):
#   * repo cloned at $HOME/blc-social-audit (override with BLC_REPO_DIR)
#   * the read-only git deploy key works (`git fetch origin` succeeds)
#   * the invoking user is in the `docker` group (no sudo needed)
#   * a production .env exists in the repo dir (gitignored; survives git reset)
