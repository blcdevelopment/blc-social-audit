"""Pure builder for the report's AI Visibility section.

Turns normalized :class:`AiVisibilityFacts` into a deterministic presentation payload: a headline
visibility score + metric tiles, the per-LLM distribution, top topics, competitors, and by-country
rows. It is *presentation only* — it never changes a score (scoring invariant) — and returns
``None`` when there is nothing to show, so the report renders byte-identically when AI-visibility
enrichment did not run.
