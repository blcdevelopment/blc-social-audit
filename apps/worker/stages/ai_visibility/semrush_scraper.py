"""Semrush AI Visibility login-bot (Playwright).

Signs into the operator's OWN Semrush account, opens the AI Visibility overview for a domain,
screenshots the dashboard, and hands the images to the vision extractor. Semrush publishes no API
for this toolkit, so this UI automation is the only programmatic route (see
``docs/20_SEMRUSH_AI_VISIBILITY_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`` — the ToS/compliance decision is the
operator's, and this runs low-volume, on-demand, from a single server-side account).

Design for robustness + low detection surface:
- **Reuse a saved browser session** (``semrush_session_state_path``) rather than scripting the
  password every run. Establish it ONCE — ideally via ``scripts/check_semrush_ai_visibility.py
  --login`` in a headed browser so a human clears any CAPTCHA / 2FA — and the bot loads those
  cookies thereafter. An email+password login is attempted only when no session file exists.
- **Everything is wrapped** so any failure (login wall, CAPTCHA, UI change, timeout) returns
  ``None``: the collector then skips gracefully and the enrichment task restores its snapshot, so a
  failed scrape leaves the existing report byte-identical.

Selectors/URLs are best-effort defaults and may need tuning against the live site — they are
config-driven (``semrush_login_url`` / ``semrush_ai_visibility_url``) and the probe script is the
tool for tuning them interactively.
