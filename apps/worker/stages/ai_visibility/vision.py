"""Vision extraction — turn Semrush AI Visibility dashboard screenshots into typed facts.

Semrush has no API for the AI Visibility Toolkit, so we screenshot the rendered dashboard and read
the numbers with an OpenAI vision model using the SDK's structured-output parse (the exact
``client.responses.parse(..., text_format=Model)`` pattern the dormant commentary scaffolding uses,
extended with image inputs). The model returns an :class:`AiVisibilityExtraction`; a drifted shape
is rejected and retried at the SDK layer.

This is a *fact source* for a report section — it never touches scoring. It runs only inside the
on-demand enrichment task (never the always-on pipeline), so it adds no cost to a normal audit and
does not affect reproducibility. On any error it raises; the caller (the scraper) turns that into a
``None`` fetch so the collector skips gracefully.
