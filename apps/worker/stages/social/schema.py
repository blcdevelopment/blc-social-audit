"""Typed common schema for the social-audit fact bundle (P2-22 / SMWA-74).

A single, validated source of truth for the ``social.*`` facts that ``rubrics/social.yaml``
scores. Every provider's normalizer (Instagram / Facebook / YouTube) builds the SAME
``SocialProfileFacts`` shape, and ``summarize_profiles`` builds the SAME ``SocialSummary``;
the rubric ``fact_path`` values map 1:1 onto these field names. ``extra="forbid"`` makes a
typo or a drifted field a hard error instead of a silently-missing fact.

The models are intentionally a *contract*, not behaviour — the normalizers in ``extractor``
compute the values and hand them here; ``.model_dump()`` returns the plain dicts the rest of
the pipeline already expects (scoring navigates them by ``fact_path``), so wrapping them
changes nothing observable while guaranteeing the extractor and the rubric stay in lockstep
(see ``tests/unit/test_social_schema.py``).
