"""Niche -> acceptable-business-category taxonomy + matcher (SAE-4 / completes SAE-9).

Elda's review asks us to check a business is listed under the RIGHT category on Facebook/
Instagram/Google (contractor, remodeler, interior designer, ...), not merely that *a* category
is set. This maps the audit's free-text ``niche`` to a family of acceptable category strings and
answers "does this profile's category fit the niche?".

Design for safety (this is client-facing): the matcher returns ``None`` — meaning "can't tell,
skip the rule" — whenever the niche can't be confidently classified, so a vague niche never
produces a false "wrong category" finding. Only a niche we recognize AND a category we can compare
yields True/False.

>>> STARTER TAXONOMY — pending sign-off from Elda. The home-services family below is a reasonable
default for BLC's builder/remodeler audience; confirm/extend ``NICHE_CATEGORY_FAMILIES`` with the
real category strings Elda's team uses before treating category-relevance findings as authoritative.
