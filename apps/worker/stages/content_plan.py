"""Deterministic content plan for audit commentary.

This is the canonical source of truth for what a report *says*: which findings exist,
in what order, their severity and remediation tier, and the baseline prose for each.
It is a pure function of the score breakdown + extracted facts, so the same site always
produces the same findings and recommendations - with or without an LLM.

An optional LLM polish layer (Phase 2) may later rewrite the prose strings, but it can
never add, drop, reorder, or invent a finding. See docs/11_COMMENTARY_CONSISTENCY_PLAN.md.

Grounding-safety invariant: every number emitted here is either a section/composite score
or a rule's ``evidence.value`` (the resolved fact at its ``fact_path``). Both are present
in the grounding fact sources, so the deterministic baseline is never stripped. Do not
emit derived/aggregate numbers that are not stored facts.
